            12 days ago I opened a ticket because I needed help finding the hot folder so I can scan documents to this folder and the system would process them. Simply put, scan document X to folder Y, the system grabs document X and takes care of it. Simple enough? I wasn&rsquo;t really clear on how it worked, I just mentioned hot folder thinking they would understand what I meant, that was my fault, I shouldn&rsquo;t have internal slang for this.

            So for two weeks now I&rsquo;ve been running Dokku on DigitalOcean for my Meteor apps (and some old PHP apps as well). I&rsquo;ve read a few guides about it, but I feel they all leave something out so I&rsquo;ll try to collect everything I&rsquo;ve learned so far about the subject. What is Dokku? Docker powered mini-Heroku. The smallest PaaS implementation you&rsquo;ve ever seen. Run docker containers without knowing Docker, push code via git and support for buildpacks.

            Yesterday Heroku announced the good bye to free tier as we know it. The short story is, free tier was abused by people pinging their dynos to stay alive 24&frasl;7 (they went to sleep after an hour of inactivity before), and now they introduced a hobby tier which is basically the same as the old free tier (without the sleep) for $7 a month. Pretty good deal, but I already have so much server power on premise that I feel I can&rsquo;t justify paying another provider to host my stuff.

            Yesterday I created a simple API to get the closest NCS of a hex triplet (and then the hex triplet of that NCS). I later expanded it into a site where you can use the API without implementing it yourself and see the color it locates. You can find the site at http://code.maxmalm.se/ncs/ Yes, I know the image refers to the Pantone color chart instead of NCS. The site uses Kimono Labs and Encycolorpedia to serve you this data.

            What I would like to see is an open source dashboard for all the data you can imagine. Something like https://ducksboard.com/ but no API connection is built in. You want to add Google Analytics? Write a package or see if someone else has built one. Couldn&rsquo;t find one and you actually made one? Publish it let others use it in their own dashboard. This just popped into my head yesterday while trying to sleep.

            Yesterday I started my trial run with Joylent to see how my body reacts to it. For now I&rsquo;m going to eat Joylent as my primary food source for 9 days coupled with whey protein after workouts. The plan is to do this trial run for 9 days, see how I feel and if I feel good enough I&rsquo;m going to take a break then do it for 30 days. Joylent (a variant of Soylent) is a nutrional drink containing 100% of the daily intake of everything.

            This is the first book I&rsquo;ve read in a long long time. Probably the first one in English since I left school. This is the story about Quentin and his neighbour, Margo. Quentin is the typical nerdy kid and Margo is the to be prom queen. Margo turns Quentin&rsquo;s life around and runs away, Quentin then feels he have to find Margo with the help of the clues she left behind.

            A couple of months ago I made a small site to track parcels sent via Posten (Swedish postal service) with Pushbullet. It&rsquo;s really simple, you put in you Pushbullet access token, your tracking ID and put a name for the event (if you call it &ldquo;headphones&rdquo;, every push will have that title). You&rsquo;ll get a push confirming it works then you&rsquo;ll get a push every time the status of the parcel changes (checks every 5 minutes).

            Since I&rsquo;ve started trying out Meteor for development I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot of what kind of application I want to make. Maybe Meteor isn&rsquo;t the right platform to use for this project at all, but I want to try it out to really dive into the language. The idea came from me using Stronglifts 5x5 app. It&rsquo;s very limiting until recently and the free version only let&rsquo;s you do the absolute program they&rsquo;ve decided.
