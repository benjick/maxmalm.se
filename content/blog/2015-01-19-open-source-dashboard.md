title: "Open source dashboard with packages"

What I would like to see is an open source dashboard for all the data you can imagine. Something like https://ducksboard.com/ but no API connection is built in. You want to add Google Analytics? Write a package or see if someone else has built one. Couldn't find one and you actually made one? Publish it let others use it in their own dashboard.

This just popped into my head yesterday while trying to sleep. I haven't fleshed out any details but I might write more in depth and try to produce this.
