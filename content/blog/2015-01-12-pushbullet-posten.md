A couple of months ago I made a small site to track parcels sent via Posten (Swedish postal service) with Pushbullet.

It's really simple, you put in you Pushbullet access token, your tracking ID and put a name for the event (if you call it "headphones", every push will have that title). You'll get a push confirming it works then you'll get a push every time the status of the parcel changes (checks every 5 minutes). Once the status is set to delivered

Enjoy! <http://code.maxmalm.se/posten>
