Yesterday I started my trial run with Joylent to see how my body reacts to it. For now I'm going to eat Joylent as my primary food source for 9 days coupled with whey protein after workouts. The plan is to do this trial run for 9 days, see how I feel and if I feel good enough I'm going to take a break then do it for 30 days. 

Joylent (a variant of [Soylent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_%28drink%29)) is a nutrional drink containing 100% of the daily intake of everything. Each bag of powder contains 2119 kcal and it's recommended to eat in three meals. I'm going to do this with [intermittent fasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting) for two meals. Half after work and half after workout.

Should these 9 days go well I'm planning the following for the 30 days:

**Monday**: Workout (SL 5x5). IF meals and whey protein    
**Tuesday**: IF meals. Some light walking.    
**Wednesday**: Workout (SL 5x5). IF meals and whey protein    
**Thursday**: IF meals. Some light walking.    
**Friday**: Workout (SL 5x5). IF meals and whey protein    
**Saturday**: Three meals of Joylent spread out over the day    
**Sunday**: IF meals. Some light walking.
